# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is te disciplined process of designing ,developing,testing and maintaining software systems by creating reliable ,scalable and efficient soutions.software engineering ensures the development of high-quality, relable and scalable software by optimizing the cost and the time efficiency,enhances maintainability, and incoporates security best practices to protect against cybe threats.by fostering innovation and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration, it drives technological advancements ultimately, software engineering supports the creation of impactful ,global-used technologies that transform industries and improve lives

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1>>>>High level programming language it was invented between 1950s-1960s where there was introduction of language like fortran and cobal which made programming more accessible and efficint, enabling complex software development
2>>>>software crisis and birth of softwre engineering  the nato conference highlighted the need for a disciplined approach, formalizing software engineering as a field to address project failure and improve reliability
3>>>>agile methodologies  the agile manifesto promoted iterative development, customer collaboration and flexibility, revolutinizing software practices for faster, user-focused delivery

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1-Planning: Define the project and plan for launch
    2-Requirements analysis: Gather requirements and analyze the problem and solution
    3-Design: Design the product architecture and framework
    4-Coding: Develop and code the product
    5-Testing: Test the product for quality and functionality
    6-Deployment: Release the product to customers
    7-Maintenance: Maintain the product and address any issues 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
